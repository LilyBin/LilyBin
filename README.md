### Running LilyBin

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/).

Clone the repository and run `npm install` to download required node modules.

Run `docker pull trevordixon/lilypond` to fetch the Docker image containing the
latest versions of LilyPond. (LilyBin uses Docker to compile scores in a
sandboxed environment. It looks for a Docker image named `trevordixon/lilypond`
and runs each compilation in a new container.)

The Dockerfile used to build that image is located at
[trevordixon/docker-lilypond](https://github.com/trevordixon/docker-lilypond).

Launch LilyBin with `node server.js`. Navigate to
[http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001), and you should be presented
with an editor pane and a successfully rendered score.
